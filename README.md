# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Algorithm in R
A simple, supervised machine learning algorithm for solving classification and regression problems, implemented in R.

## Features
* Easy to implement with only two parameters: K and the distance measure.
* Can work with any number of classes.
## Limitations
* Known as a "lazy learner" as it only stores the data in the training phase and does not perform any calculation.
* May not work well with high-dimension data.
## Data
The data used in this implementation is the "Caravan" dataset from the ISLR package. It contains customer data for 6000 customers and 80 features/variables. The target is to predict if the customer purchased insurance or not from Caravan Insurance Company based on the features.
